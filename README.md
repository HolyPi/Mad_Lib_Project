Background: Mad Lib is a game that involves 2 players and a template story.
One player prompts the other player for a word with constraints to 
substitute each blank in the story. After the blanks are completely filled 
in, the story is read. Usually the story is silly and/or nonsensical.

Program: Instead of 2 living beings being involved, it will be you and the
computer. The computer will always prompting you to fill in the blanks of the
story template written by Christopher Francisco!

The program will prompt you to fill in each blank with a part of speech 
or word type. After the blanks are filled, a color key is printed to
highlight the different parts of speech/word types used. Then the story
template written by Christopher Francisco, filled with your input will be
displayed!
